# terrform-experements

I am a student at foothill college and studing AWS. The tasks I have in that class all very basic. I don't know terraform, so I use these basic tasks to learn a bit of terrform code.

The class just began, so I covered  only one module so far:
- Creation a S3 bucket with a lifecycle policy.
- Creation an EFS share with expose of mount points in several availibilty zones.
- Creation an EBS volume
