# terrform-experements

I am a student at foothill college and studying AWS. The tasks I have in that class are all very basic. I don't know terraform, so I use these basic tasks to learn a bit of terraform code.

The class just began, so I have covered  only one module so far:
- Creation an S3 bucket with a lifecycle policy.
- Creation an EFS share with exposure of mount points in several availability zones.
- Creation of an EBS volume
